                        ML-DSA for JOSE and COSE
                    draft-ietf-cose-dilithium-latest

Abstract

   This document describes JOSE and COSE serializations for ML-DSA,
   which was derived from Dilithium, a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
   based digital signature scheme.

   This document does not define any new cryptography, only
   seralizations of existing cryptographic systems described in
   [FIPS-204].

   Note to RFC Editor: This document should not proceed to AUTH48 until
   NIST completes paramater tuning and selection as a part of the PQC
   (https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography)
   standardization process.

1.  Introduction

   ML-DSA is derived from Version 3.1 of CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM, as noted in
   [FIPS-204].

   CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM is one of the post quantum cryptography algorithms
   selected in [NIST-PQC-2022].

   TODO: Add complete examples for ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, ML-DSA-87.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The ML-DSA Algorithm Family

   The ML-DSA Signature Scheme is paramaterized to support different
   security level.

   This document requests the registration of the following algorithms
   in [IANA.jose]:

4.  The ML-DSA Key Type

   Private and Public Keys are produced to enable the sign and verify
   opertaions for each of the ML-DSA Algorithms.
